To test our OCR functionality, we need a sample image file. 

You can access the OCR upload page at:
http://localhost:3000/ocr

Then upload an image of a legal document (e.g., eviction notice) to test the OCR functionality.

Here's what the system should do:
1. Process the uploaded image
2. Extract text using OCR (Tesseract)
3. Detect document type, names, dates, and issues
4. Return a structured JSON response

If you need test images, you can use files in the 'attached_assets' folder.

Example curl command for testing:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ocr-upload \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/your/eviction_notice.png'
```
