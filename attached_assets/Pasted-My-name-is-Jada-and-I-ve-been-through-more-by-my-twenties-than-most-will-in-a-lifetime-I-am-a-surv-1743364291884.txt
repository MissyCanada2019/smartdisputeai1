My name is Jada, and I’ve been through more by my twenties than most will in a lifetime. I am a survivor of childhood trauma, betrayal, addiction, loss, and heartbreak—but I am still standing.

At 10 years old, I was already carrying more than a child ever should. Fear of disappointing my mom led to a decision that changed everything—setting a fire to hide a bad test. That moment set off a chain of events that exposed just how alone I really was. Kicked out at 15 and abandoned by those who were supposed to protect me, I found comfort and care in the kindness of someone else’s mother, who became my true guardian angel.

A tragic accident in shop class landed me in the ICU, fighting for my life. I flatlined during surgery and lost a finger, but the emotional scars ran deeper than the physical ones. My parents didn’t come until the day before I was discharged. The woman who stood by my side the entire time—my friend’s mom—gave up everything to be there for me. She literally saved my life, more than once. I owe her everything, and losing her recently shook me to my core.

After the accident, I spiraled. I was bullied, broken, and addicted to the painkillers that were supposed to help me heal. I tried to take my own life, thinking it would finally quiet the pain. But life had other plans.

I got engaged at 18, dreaming of stability and love. Instead, I walked into betrayal and lost everything again—my home, my college dreams, my job, and eventually, myself. My mother, instead of offering comfort, offered cocaine. That one line destroyed the progress I had fought for and began a long, painful chapter of my life marked by addiction and a criminal record.

But in 2017, my son Landon was born. For the first time in forever, I had hope. He became my reason to fight, and I got clean. But addiction is a beast—and one wrong decision took everything away again. One night turned into another year behind bars. While waiting for bail, I was handed papers that said my son had been declared an orphan. That moment shattered me.

After my release, tension with my mom reached a breaking point. A violent altercation led to a decision I never imagined I’d make. I was scared. I was cornered. But somehow, from all of that pain, something changed. My mother and I rebuilt our relationship. She got clean. I got stronger. We’re now closer than we’ve ever been.

This isn’t just a story of survival—it’s one of redemption, raw truth, and rising from the ashes. I’m Jada, and I’m not a victim of my past. I’m a warrior shaped by it.
