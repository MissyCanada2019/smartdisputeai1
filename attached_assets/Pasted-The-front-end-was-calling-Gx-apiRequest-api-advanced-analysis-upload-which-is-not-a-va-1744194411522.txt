The front-end was calling Gx.apiRequest("/api/advanced-analysis/upload", { ... }), which is not a valid function in this context. This appears to be a leftover from a Replit-specific API or an incorrect attempt to use an API helper. In a normal web app, this call fails (hence the error). We need to replace it with a standard HTTP request (e.g. using fetch). Also, the backend must properly handle the incoming file data. Solution: Use the Fetch API with a FormData payload to upload the file, and update the server to accept multipart form data (e.g. with Express and Multer). This approach is straightforward and doesn’t rely on any unavailable globals. Steps to implement:
Front-End: Create a FormData object, append the file (and any other fields like province), and send it with fetch to the upload endpoint. Do not manually set the Content-Type header – the browser will set the proper multipart/form-data boundary for you​
DEVELOPER.MOZILLA.ORG
. For example:
js
Copy
Edit
// Frontend (e.g., in a React component or vanilla JS script)
async function handleAnalyzeDocument() {
  if (!selectedFile) return;
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', selectedFile);
  formData.append('province', selectedProvince);  // include additional data if needed

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/advanced-analysis/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Server error: ${response.status}`);
    const result = await response.json();
    // Update UI with analysis results
    setComplexity(result.complexity);
    setSimplifiedTerms(result.simplifiedText);
    setMeritWeight(result.meritWeight);
    setStrategy(result.strategy);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Upload/Analysis failed:', err);
    setError("Analysis failed. Please try again.");
  }
}
In the code above, we replaced the nonexistent Gx.apiRequest with fetch. We build a FormData containing the file. The fetch call posts to our backend route and then we handle the JSON response (populating state with complexity, simplified terms, merit weight, etc.). This ensures the document is uploaded correctly using standard APIs​
DEVELOPER.MOZILLA.ORG
. (If you had previously set any custom headers for the upload, remove them, as they can interfere with FormData boundaries​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
.)
Back-End: Ensure the Express server can receive and process the file upload. Typically, you should use a middleware like Multer to handle multipart/form-data in Express​
EXPRESSJS.COM
. Multer will parse the incoming form data and provide the file on req.file. For example, in your Express app setup:
js
Copy
Edit
// Backend (ExpressJS with Multer for file uploads)
const express = require('express');
const multer  = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() }); // store file in memory (or configure disk storage)

const app = express();
// (Other middleware like express.json() if needed for JSON bodies, etc.)

app.post('/api/advanced-analysis/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Access the uploaded file and any text fields:
    const file = req.file;                   // the uploaded file object (e.g. PDF or DOCX)
    const province = req.body.province;      // the province field from form, if sent
    if (!file) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No file uploaded' });
    }

    // TODO: Extract text from file if it's not plain text.
    const fileBuffer = file.buffer;
    const textContent = fileBuffer.toString('utf-8');  // example for plain text; use PDF parser if PDF

    // Perform analysis using AI (OpenAI/Claude) or other logic:
    const analysisResults = await performAnalysis(textContent, province);
    // `performAnalysis` is a placeholder for your AI calls (e.g., OpenAI API).
    // It should return an object with keys: complexity, simplifiedText, meritWeight, strategy.

    // Send back the results as JSON
    res.json(analysisResults);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Analysis error:', err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Analysis failed' });
  }
});
In this snippet, upload.single('file') (from Multer) handles the multipart parsing​
EXPRESSJS.COM
. The uploaded file is available as req.file and any additional form fields (like province) are in req.body​
EXPRESSJS.COM
. We then convert the file to text (this will differ based on file type: for a plain text file or JSON, toString('utf-8') works; for PDFs or Word docs you’d use a parser library). Next, we call performAnalysis – this represents the code that uses GPT-4/Claude or other logic to analyze the text. Finally, we return a JSON response containing all the analysis outputs.
After these changes: The front-end will successfully upload the document to the server via fetch. The server, using Multer, will receive the file and perform the analysis. The Gx.apiRequest error will be gone, and the upload should work reliably.
2. Fixing the "Merit Weight" Calculation Feature
Cause: The "Case merit weight calculation" feature was not showing any result. This can happen if the backend isn’t computing or returning the merit weight, or if the front-end isn’t displaying it. Common causes include: not including the field in the JSON response, a mismatch in naming (e.g. backend sends meritWeight but front-end expects merit), or the analysis logic never actually produces a merit score. Solution: We need to implement or correct the merit weight calculation in the analysis logic and ensure the value flows through to the UI. Here’s how:
Compute the Merit Weight in Back-End Analysis: If you are using AI to evaluate case merit, modify the prompt or logic to yield a clear numeric score or category for the case's merit. For example, you might ask the model: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how strong are the merits of this case?” or have it include a field in a JSON response. Make sure your performAnalysis (or equivalent) returns a value for meritWeight. For instance, if using OpenAI’s Chat API, you could instruct the model to respond in JSON format with a meritWeight field. Then parse the model’s response to extract that field. If the model’s output is textual, you may need to parse it or convert it into a numeric score.
Include meritWeight in the Response: Ensure the object you send back in res.json contains the merit weight. In the code snippet above, we already prepare analysisResults to include meritWeight. For example, if performAnalysis returns an object:
js
Copy
Edit
{
  complexity: "Moderate",
  simplifiedText: "Simplified explanations...",
  meritWeight: 7,            // e.g., 7 out of 10
  strategy: "Suggested strategy..."
}
then res.json(analysisResults) will correctly send this to the client. Double-check that the property name matches what the front-end expects. If the front-end uses result.meritWeight (camelCase), send it in camelCase. Consistency is key.
Update Front-End to Display Merit Weight: Make sure the front-end uses the returned merit weight. In the earlier front-end snippet, we call setMeritWeight(result.meritWeight). You should have state or a UI element to show this value. For example, in React you might have:
jsx
Copy
Edit
const [meritWeight, setMeritWeight] = useState(null);
...
{meritWeight !== null && (
  <div>Case Merit Weight: <b>{meritWeight}/10</b></div>
)}
This will display the merit weight score once it's set. If you want it as a percentage or different scale, adjust accordingly (e.g., if using 0–100, show “${meritWeight}%”). The key is that after receiving the analysis response, you call the state update with the merit weight value so that it appears in the UI. If this was missing before, adding it will make the feature come alive.
Verify the Flow: After implementing the above, test the full cycle. Upload a document, let the analysis run, and ensure that the response contains a merit weight. You can console.log(result) on the front-end to verify the object. The UI should now show the merit weight score or rating. If it’s not in the response, trace back to your analysis function to be sure the AI is providing it. You might need to fine-tune the prompt or even do a secondary request. For example, if the document is very long, you could use Claude (which handles longer context) to get a merit assessment. The simplest approach, though, is to have the primary analysis call (GPT-4) also return a merit evaluation.
Example backend adjustment for merit weight: If using OpenAI, you could do something like:
js
Copy
Edit
// Pseudocode inside performAnalysis:
const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a legal assistant AI... (instructions) ..." },
    { role: "user", content: `Analyze the following case document and provide:
      1. Complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex),
      2. Simplify any legal jargon,
      3. A merit score 1-10 for the case's strength,
      4. Recommended strategy.
      Document: """${textContent}"""` }
  ]
});
// Assuming the assistant responds with a JSON or a structured format:
const aiOutput = completion.data.choices[0].message.content;
let complexity, simplifiedText, meritWeight, strategy;
try {
  const parsed = JSON.parse(aiOutput);
  ({ complexity, simplifiedText, meritWeight, strategy } = parsed);
} catch {
  // Fallback parsing if not JSON:
  // ...extract values from aiOutput with string methods or regex...
}
// Return the results object:
return { complexity, simplifiedText, meritWeight, strategy };
The exact implementation will depend on how you want to structure the AI response, but the core idea is to capture a merit score and include it in the data returned to the client. If you use Anthropic’s Claude for part of this, ensure its response also includes a merit rating and combine results as needed. After these changes: The "Case merit weight calculation" feature will be functional. The backend provides a merit weight value, and the front-end displays it. For example, users might see something like “Case Merit Weight: 7/10” (or “70%”, depending on your design), indicating the strength of their case as evaluated by the AI.
3. Testing the Updated Features
After implementing the fixes above, thoroughly test the application:
Upload a document (e.g., a sample legal case description) and ensure it is accepted without errors. The console error about Gx.apiRequest should be gone. The network tab (if using a browser dev tools) should show a successful POST request to /api/advanced-analysis/upload returning a JSON payload.
Confirm that all analysis features are populated. You should get a complexity assessment, simplified terms, and a merit weight score, along with strategy recommendations. If any field comes back undefined, double-check the spelling and presence in both the server response and front-end code.
Test edge cases: try a different file or a very large document (to see if your AI calls handle it), and verify that even then the upload works and the app either handles the size or gives a user-friendly error.
By replacing the faulty API call with fetch and by properly implementing the merit weight logic, the application’s document upload and analysis features (including merit weight) should now work reliably. These changes align the code with standard web practices and ensure full functionality of the intended features. Sources:
