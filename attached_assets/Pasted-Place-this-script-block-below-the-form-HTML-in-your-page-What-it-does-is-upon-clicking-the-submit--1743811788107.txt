Place this script block below the form HTML in your page. What it does is, upon clicking the submit button, right when the form is about to send, it logs an event to dataLayer. GTM (if configured) will catch that.
In GTM, create a trigger for Custom Event = "form_submit" (matches the event name we pushed). Then create a GA4 Event tag (similar to earlier) to send an event (again, maybe call it form_submit or lead_submit). Attach the custom event trigger to it.
This way, even if you don’t have a thank-you page, the act of submitting will fire a GA event. One caveat: if the page navigates away too quickly (like to an external thank-you or just closes), the event might not send in time. GTM’s Form trigger has an option "Wait for tags" which can delay the navigation a moment to allow the hit to send​

. But since Formspree redirects to your thank-you page, that counts as navigation within your site, so it should be okay (the GA tag will likely fire before the new page fully loads). To be safe, using the actual thank-you page as the signal is more straightforward.
For reliability and ease, I recommend using the Thank You page method. It’s simple: user submits -> they get to thank-you page -> GA4 sees that page_view. Just make sure no one can accidentally land on the thank-you page without submitting (you might not link it anywhere visible). Marking Conversions in GA4: However you track the submission (page view or event), in GA4 go to Admin → Events and mark the appropriate event as a conversion (flip the switch next to it). If using page_view method, set up the custom event as described then mark it. If using a custom event like form_submit, mark that. From then on, GA4 will show this as a conversion in reports. Verify the tracking: Do a test submission yourself. Fill out the form on the live site (perhaps use a test email so you can identify it) and submit. Check that you get redirected and that GA4 logs the conversion. In Replit’s logs (or your email, if using Formspree and your email is connected), you should also see the submission come through. In GA4 Realtime, you should see the form_submit or page_view for thank-you event. This is an important test to ensure your funnel’s final step is being recorded. A quick note on GA4’s Enhanced Measurement – GA4 can automatically track a generic form_submit event in some cases​

. But this auto-tracking isn’t always reliable across all site setups (it might not catch if the form action goes to another domain, etc., and sometimes it fires even on incomplete submits). Relying on our explicit tracking as above is safer and gives you control.
Additional Form Best Practices:
After submission, provide feedback to the user (which is what the thank-you page is for). If not using a separate page, at least show a “Thank you, we’ll be in touch” message on the same page via JS, and ensure the form is hidden or disabled to prevent duplicates.
Ensure you have some sort of validation on the form fields (HTML5 required as used, and proper input types help, e.g., type="email" triggers basic email format validation).
Consider adding a CAPTCHA or honeypot field to reduce spam submissions, especially if the form is publicly accessible and using a service like Formspree (which could potentially be targeted by bots).
If you need to comply with privacy laws, include a short disclaimer or link to a privacy policy below the form, especially since you’re collecting personal data (name, contact info). Something like: “We respect your privacy. Your information will only be used to contact you about your inquiry.”
By implementing the form carefully and tracking its submissions, you now have the full picture in your analytics: from landing on the page, clicking the CTA, to submitting the form – the entire funnel is measured.
5. Best Practices for a Multi-Page Service Website
Since your site is multi-page (perhaps with pages for different services, an about page, etc.), it’s important to design the overall site architecture to facilitate conversions and maintain a good user experience on every page. Here are some best practices:
Consistent Navigation Menu: Use a simple, uniform navigation bar across all pages​
PAGECAFE.COM
. Typically, this is a top menu that might include links like Home, Services (with dropdown if multiple), About, Contact, etc. Keeping the same menu structure on every page avoids confusing visitors and lets them move around easily​
PAGECAFE.COM
. For mobile, implement a responsive nav (like a hamburger menu) that is easy to tap and shows the same options. The navigation should be clean and not overloaded with too many items – remember, giving fewer clear choices can actually improve decision-making and conversions​
PAGECAFE.COM
. If you have multiple service pages, ensure the nav highlights which one is active (a subtle highlight or different color on the current page link) so users know where they are.
Prominent Contact/CTA in Navigation: Consider including your primary CTA in the menu as well – for example, a “Contact Us” or “Get Started” button on the top right of the nav bar (styled as a button to stand out). Many websites do this so that no matter what page a user is on, the invitation to convert is one click away. On desktop, this could be a brightly colored button in the header. On mobile, you might have it as a standout menu item or even a persistent footer button. The idea is to make conversion possible from any page, not just the homepage. A user reading your “Services” details page might be convinced and ready to contact you from that page – don’t make them hunt for how to do so. A consistent CTA in the nav or footer solves this.
Unified Design and Message: All pages on the site should reinforce your value proposition and have a cohesive design. Use the same color scheme, typography, and voice in content. If your landing page has a tagline, you might echo or reference it on other pages to remind users of your unique selling point. This consistency builds credibility. Trust signals (like logos, testimonials) used on the homepage can also be featured on inner pages, perhaps in a sidebar or footer, to continually reassure visitors no matter what page they enter on.
Page-specific Content with CTA tie-ins: Each page should have a clear purpose and ideally a mini-funnel of its own that leads to the CTA. For example, if you have separate pages for different services you offer, each of those pages should outline that specific service’s benefits, maybe show a case study or testimonial related to it, and then end with a CTA like “Interested in our [Service Name]? Contact us to get started.” Ensure that every page has some call-to-action, even if it’s not as large as the homepage hero. The CTA could be a form (like a newsletter signup in the footer) or a button linking to the contact page. The key is: never leave a dead end. A user reading any page should always know what to do next (e.g., contact you, sign up, etc.).
Avoid Too Many Distractions: While a multi-page site naturally has more links and info, be cautious about adding extraneous outbound links or dense menus that lead users astray. For instance, if you have a blog, that’s great for SEO and educating users, but once a user is in “conversion mode” (perhaps reading about your service), minimize distractions like unrelated sidebar links. Keep any calls-to-action in those contexts related to your service (like inline banners to contact or relevant case studies). In other words, keep the user on a focused path relevant to the service funnel.
Cross-Link Relevant Pages: Guide users logically. If someone is on Service A page, and you have Service B that’s related, you might have a section like “Need help with [Other Topic]? Check out our [Service B] as well.” – and link it. Or from a general “About Us” page, you might include a CTA to “View our Services” or “Contact us for more info” at the end. This kind of cross-linking keeps users engaged and moving toward conversion rather than hitting a dead end. However, avoid overloading pages with too many cross-links, which can be paralyzing. Always ask, what is the primary action I want from this page? and focus on that.
Analytics Across Pages (User Journey Tracking): With GA4 set up, you automatically track users across all pages in a session. This means you can analyze the user flow through your site. GA4’s Path Exploration or Funnel Exploration can show you common paths (e.g., Home → Services → Contact) and where drop-offs happen​
SUPPORT.GOOGLE.COM
. It’s a good practice to periodically check these reports. You might discover, for instance, that many users visit your pricing page but then leave without contacting – that could signal you need to make the pricing page more convincing or include a contact form right there. Because you have a multi-page funnel, consider defining a conversion funnel in GA4: for example, step 1: view any service page; step 2: click CTA; step 3: form submitted. This can quantify the drop-off at each step. In GA4, you can create a Funnel Analysis in the Explore section to do this.
Use Event Tracking on Multiple Pages: We set up CTA click tracking and form tracking. If you have different CTAs on different pages (maybe one page has a “Download PDF” CTA and another has “Schedule Call”), track those as well. With GTM, you can add triggers for those specific buttons. Ensure you label events distinctly (e.g., pdf_download, schedule_call_click) so you know which is which. Consistently capturing these interactions across pages will give you a fuller picture of engagement. It also allows you to see which pages or CTAs are performing better.
Maintain Fast Load and Mobile Optimization site-wide: Each page should be quick and mobile-friendly, not just the homepage. Users might land on any page from search results. So, optimize images on all pages (e.g., don’t upload a huge photo on an inner page without compressing it). Use responsive design everywhere. Google’s PageSpeed Insights can help identify slow pages​
BLOG.AWEBER.COM
. Faster pages and good mobile UX will keep users from bouncing before converting.
SEO and Content: A benefit of a multi-page site is you can tailor each page for specific topics/keywords (helping organic search). Ensure each page has a clear SEO-friendly title and meta description so that if a user finds that page via Google, they see a relevant snippet. While SEO is a separate topic, it supports the funnel by bringing in more qualified traffic to specific pages. Just make sure that once that traffic lands, the page is effective at funneling them to your CTA. For example, your “Service X” page might be the landing page for those who searched for Service X — make sure that page alone provides enough info and a CTA to convert them, as they might not even see your homepage.
Monitor and Iterate: Once everything is in place, use your analytics to find where users drop off. Maybe a lot of users visit Service pages but few click the CTA there – perhaps the CTA is not noticeable enough on those pages or the content isn’t convincing. Maybe mobile users drop off more than desktop – that could indicate some mobile layout issue. Use tools like Hotjar or session recordings (if you choose to) for qualitative insight, but GA4 will give plenty of quantitative data. You can run A/B tests on critical pages (for example, test a different headline or a different CTA color) using Google Optimize or other tools to see if it improves conversion – though with low traffic, focus on obvious improvements first (clarity of content, placement of buttons, etc., which we covered).
By adhering to these multi-page best practices, you ensure that the entire site, not just the main landing page, is working together to drive conversions. All pages ultimately point toward the same goal (getting leads/sales), and you make it easy for the user to reach that goal from wherever they are on the site. Meanwhile, your analytics will capture their journey step by step, allowing you to refine the funnel over time.
Conclusion: You now have a comprehensive plan to optimize your Replit-hosted service website for conversions. Start by structuring your landing page content to funnel user attention from a compelling headline to a standout CTA, make that CTA omnipresent and track every click and scroll with Google Tag Manager, and implement a frictionless contact form that feeds conversion data into Google Analytics. With consistent design and clear navigation across all pages, users will have a seamless experience — whether they land on the homepage or any inner page — and you’ll have the measurement tools needed to continually improve your funnel. Remember to keep monitoring your analytics (CTA click rates, form conversion rates, page drop-offs) and iterate on the content or design where needed. By combining strong UX design with data-driven insights, you’ll create an optimized conversion funnel that turns more visitors into clients for your services. Good luck, and happy converting!
