The Find My Representative section is already well-implemented. To further enhance it, here are some recommendations for design and usability improvements:
	‚Ä¢	Provide Input Validation and Feedback: Implement client-side validation for the postal code format. For example, you could enforce the pattern [A-Z][0-9][A-Z] [0-9][A-Z][0-9] as the user types, or at least check it on submit. If the input doesn‚Äôt match or if the API returns no reps, display a friendly error message (e.g., ‚ÄúPlease enter a valid Canadian postal code‚Äù). This guides the user to correct mistakes and informs them why no results appeared.
	‚Ä¢	Group Representatives by Level: To make the output even clearer, consider grouping the representatives by government level. For instance, you could list them under subheadings like Federal, Provincial, Municipal. Under Federal, list the MP; under Provincial, list the MPP/MLA; under Municipal, list the Mayor and Councillors. This way, users immediately understand who is who. Since the API returns officials from all levels Ôøº, grouping them provides context. It would prevent any confusion over duplicates (e.g., a councilor appearing under two categories could be listed under one with a note if needed). Grouping also educates users on the different tiers of representation.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid Duplicate Listings: If the same person comes through multiple times (due to overlapping roles in different jurisdictions), you can filter out exact duplicate entries before displaying, or display the role as something combined. For example, instead of showing a councilor twice, you might combine their roles like ‚ÄúCouncillor (City & Region) ‚Äì Name ‚Äì Email‚Äù. However, simplest is to remove one if the name and email are identical, to declutter the list.
	‚Ä¢	Loading Indicator: Add a small loading animation or message when the search is in progress. This could be as simple as a spinning icon next to the button, or changing the button text to ‚ÄúSearching‚Ä¶‚Äù. Given the API is usually fast, this is optional, but on slower networks it improves perceived performance and prevents the user from clicking multiple times.
	‚Ä¢	Make Emails Clickable: Ensure that the listed email addresses are clickable mailto links (if not already implemented). Currently, they appear as plain text (though we suspect they might already be links). Making them <a href="mailto:..."> links would allow users on both mobile and desktop to directly open their email client by tapping the address, which is convenient. If possible, also make them visually distinct (blue text or an email icon) so users recognize they can click to email.
	‚Ä¢	Enhance Instructional Text: If not already present, add a brief description beneath the section title explaining the feature. For example: ‚ÄúNot sure who represents you? Enter your postal code to find your Member of Parliament, provincial representative, and local council members.‚Äù This one-sentence explanation can help users understand why this feature is useful and what to expect from the results. It sets the context that multiple representatives will be found.
	‚Ä¢	Minor UI Polishes: A few small design tweaks could elevate the look:
	‚Ä¢	Add a bit more spacing (margin-top) above and below the postal code input, so it doesn‚Äôt appear cramped against other elements.
	‚Ä¢	If using placeholder text in the input, use a meaningful example like ‚Äúe.g. H0H 0H0‚Äù (a fun example, Santa‚Äôs postal code, or a real one like ‚ÄúM5H 2N2‚Äù) to illustrate format.
	‚Ä¢	Consider using a subtle Canadian flag üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (flag emoji or an icon) next to the section title or as a background watermark in the section. This can reinforce the theme visually. (Use this sparingly to keep the professional tone‚Äîmaybe an icon next to the heading or on the search button).
	‚Ä¢	If the list of representatives is long, use alternating background shades or dividers between entries to improve readability in list form. For example, a light grey divider line or a very light shaded background for each entry can help distinguish one rep‚Äôs info from the next.
	‚Ä¢	Responsive Enhancement: While the feature is responsive, one improvement is to ensure long text wraps nicely. Specifically, you can add CSS to break long strings (like an email) if needed, or shorten the display of extremely long party names with an ellipsis on small screens with a way to view full text (tooltip or expanding). Most party names are short (Liberal, Conservative, etc.), so this is a minor point. Additionally, test on a small-screen device with large default fonts (accessibility settings) to ensure the layout still holds up. Tweaking font sizes or using relative units can help maintain the design for users who zoom or increase text size.
	‚Ä¢	Contextual Integration: To tie this feature back into the overall LegalAssist app‚Äôs purpose, you might add a call-to-action or note after the results. For example, ‚ÄúNow that you know your representatives, you can consider reaching out to them for support or to voice your concerns regarding your dispute.‚Äù This encourages users to use the information provided. It subtly links the representative info to the idea of seeking help or advocating, which complements the dispute resolution theme. This is an optional content enhancement that can give the feature more purpose within the app‚Äôs narrative.

By implementing the above suggestions, the Find My Representative section can be even more user-friendly and impactful. Most of these are minor tweaks; the core functionality is solid.
