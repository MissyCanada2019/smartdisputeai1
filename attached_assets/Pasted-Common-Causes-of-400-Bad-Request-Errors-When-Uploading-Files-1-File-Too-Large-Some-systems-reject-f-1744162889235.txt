Common Causes of 400 Bad Request Errors When Uploading Files
1. File Too Large
Some systems reject files over a certain size limit.

✅ Fix: Add a file size limit check on the frontend and backend (e.g., 10MB max).

2. Missing or Incorrect Headers
If you're not setting the Content-Type properly (especially for file uploads like multipart/form-data), the server might reject it.

✅ Fix: Ensure the request uses enctype="multipart/form-data".

3. Backend Endpoint Not Accepting the Request Format
The server may not be parsing the request body correctly.

✅ Fix: Make sure the backend (like Flask, Node, etc.) is set up to accept file uploads.

4. Frontend Form Issues
The form may be missing required fields or improperly sending data.

✅ Fix: Make sure all required fields are populated before submission and formData.append('file', file) is used correctly.

5. Filename or Data Corruption
Filenames with special characters or corrupted files can cause rejections.

✅ Fix: Sanitize filenames or rename before upload.

6. CSRF or CORS Policies
If you’re uploading from a browser and the server isn’t configured to accept the request origin, it may block it.

✅ Fix: Configure CORS headers on the backend to accept your frontend domain.

✅ Quick Checklist (Frontend)
If you're using JavaScript:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", selectedFile);

fetch("/upload-endpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
  headers: {
    // DO NOT manually set 'Content-Type' when using FormData
    // 'Content-Type' will be automatically set by the browser
  }
});
✅ Example: Python Flask Backend Snippet
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload-endpoint', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return "No file part", 400
    file = request.files['file']
    if file.filename == '':
        return "No selected file", 400
    # Save or analyze file
    file.save(f"./uploads/{file.filename}")
    return "Upload successful", 200
