About Me – Jada’s Story

My name is Jada, and I’ve lived through more than most people can imagine. From childhood trauma to heartbreak, addiction, and loss—I’ve faced darkness and come out stronger every time.

When I was 10, I set fire to my apartment trying to hide a bad test from my mom. I was terrified of disappointing her. That moment spiraled into a series of events that exposed how alone I really was. I was kicked out at 15 and had no stable family support. Thankfully, a friend’s mother took me in and showed me the kind of love and loyalty I never knew I needed.

In grade 10, a terrible accident in shop class landed me in the ICU burn unit at Hamilton General. I flatlined on the table due to blood loss and lost a finger. Neither of my parents showed up until the day before I was discharged—and when they did, all they did was scream at each other. The woman who had taken me in stayed by my side the entire time, even losing her job to be there for me. She was my angel. Losing her recently was one of the hardest things I’ve faced.

After the accident, I was bullied badly. People said I did it for attention. They called me a freak. I became addicted to the painkillers prescribed to me and hit a point where I didn’t want to live anymore. I tried to end it all, but once again, that same woman saved my life. She believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself.

At 18, I got engaged and thought I had finally found peace—until I came home one day and found my fiancé with someone else. I lost everything—my relationship, my home, my job, and eventually dropped out of the culinary arts program at Conestoga College. I hit rock bottom and didn’t see a way out.

But in 2017, my world changed. I had a beautiful baby boy, Landon. He became my reason to keep going. I got clean and stayed clean—for a while. But one night, thinking I was strong enough, I slipped. That one mistake cost me everything. I lost custody of my son and ended up back in jail. While waiting for bail, I was served papers saying my son had been declared an orphan. That crushed me.

After I was released, things escalated again. A fight with my mom turned violent. I was scared, I reacted, and I’ll carry the weight of that moment forever. But what came after was something I never expected—healing. My mom and I have rebuilt our relationship. She’s clean now and has become the mom I always needed. We’re closer than ever.

This is my story—raw, painful, and real. But it’s also a story of survival, resilience, and rising above. I’m Jada. I’ve walked through hell and came out swinging. I’m not a victim. I’m a fighter. And I’m just getting started.
