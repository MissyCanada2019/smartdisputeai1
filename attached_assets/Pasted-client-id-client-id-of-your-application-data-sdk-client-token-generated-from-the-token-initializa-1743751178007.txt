client-id: client-id of your application.
data-sdk-client-token: generated from the token initialization.
Fastlane is initialized with a call to paypal.Fastlane in the init-fastlane.js file. You must pass a configuration object during initialization.

Specify locale

You can specify the language in which the Fastlane components are rendered. After you initialize the Fastlane component, you can set the locale.

Fastlane supports the following languages; en_us (English, default), es_us (Spanish), fr_us (French), and zh_us (Mandarin).


Step 3: Capture user email address

You’ll need to render your own email field to capture the payer’s email address.

Because the email address will be shared with PayPal, it is crucial to inform the payer. We recommend to display the Fastlane watermark below the email field.


Privacy
PayPal is a data controller and business under the California Consumer Privacy Act. You'll be sharing consumer's email addresses with PayPal. We recommend you make PayPal known to your consumers by leveraging our SDK to render the "Powered by Fastlane" logo and information tooltip. If you have any questions about this feature or your compliance with data protection laws, consult your legal advisors.

After collecting the email address, PayPal determines whether the email is associated with a Fastlane profile or if it belongs to a PayPal member. Use the following code snippet to look up the customer's email.

Authenticate profile with one-time password

If the user is identified with a Fastlane profile, they need to authenticate before Fastlane retrieves their saved payment and address information. The user is presented with a screen to authenticate themselves by entering a one-time password sent to their registered mobile number.

The triggerAuthenticationFlow() method returns an AuthenticatedCustomerResult object. Use the authenticationState property in the AuthenticatedCustomerResult object to check if the payer has authenticated.

On authentication:

The Fastlane member's card details and default shipping address are returned with the profileData object contents.
The renderFastlaneMemberExperience is set to True.
If a user fails or declines to authenticate, render the same experience as you would for a guest payer.


Step 4: Render shipping address

This step is not required for:

Fastlane members without a shipping address.
Fastlane members with a shipping address in a region you don't support.
Guest payers
Continue to render your own shipping address collection form and pass it into the server-side transaction request.

For Fastlane members with a shipping address, you’ll need to render:

Shipping address returned from profile data on successful authentication.
Fastlane watermark.
Fastlane by PayPal logo.
Change address button that invokes showShippingAddressSelector().
This provides a payer with the option to change or add a new address.

Note:
Fastlane is only available for US-based customers. However, PayPal doesn’t have restrictions on shipping addresses, so the merchant can decide who they want to ship to. This can be done using the allowedShippingLocations parameter in the SDK. The merchant can disallow either countries or regions, states, or provinces and PayPal will honor that in our shipping address component and forms.
If the user adds a new address to Fastlane profile, send the new address in the Orders v2 server-side request.

Step 5: Accept payments

Fastlane offers two different integration patterns to accept payments; quick start and flexible.


Quick Start

Flexible

Quick Start

The quick start payment integration loads a pre-built template form to collect payments, requiring less integration effort. The quick start integration is PCI DSS compliant, ensuring that customer payment information is handled securely.
